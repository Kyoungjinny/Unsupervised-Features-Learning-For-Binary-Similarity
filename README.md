# Investigating Graph Embedding Neural Networks with Unsupervised Features Extraction for Binary Analysis
This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiment of the paper accept at the Workshop on Binary 
Analysis Research (BAR) 2019.

## Tasks

You can use the code two solve two different task:

- Binary Similarity with functions embeddings.
- Compiler Classification
